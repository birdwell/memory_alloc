\subsection*{First Fit}

This algorithm starts at the beginning of the memory allocaiton. It searches until it finds a spot that can hold it. It finishes here and goes with that slot.

1) Runs through the array keeping track of empty slots 2)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item It breaks out when it finds an exact slot size.
\item It resets if it finds something other than an empty string 3) It then allocates the block.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Next Fit}

This algorithm is very similar to first fit. The difference is that it keeps track of where it left off in the insertion. This alogrithm also needs to wrap around to the start if there wasn\textquotesingle{}t a found slot from the next index to the end of the memory allocation.

\subsection*{Best Fit}

This algorithm searches the whole memory allocation for the best possible spot. It can opt out if an exact spot is found.

\section*{Commands}

\subsection*{R\+E\+Q\+U\+E\+ST}

Useage\+: R\+E\+Q\+U\+E\+ST A n 
\begin{DoxyCode}
Allocates n bytes for a process named A . On successful allocation, print
ALLOCATED A x , where A is the name of the allocated process and x is
the relative location of the allocated memory. On error, print
FAIL REQUEST A n .
\end{DoxyCode}


This is the only command that isn\textquotesingle{}t shared between the algorithims. Each has their own allocate method inside memory\+\_\+algos. The implementation details will be laid out in the Memory Allocation Algorithms section.

\section*{R\+E\+L\+E\+A\+SE}

Useage\+: R\+E\+L\+E\+A\+SE A 
\begin{DoxyCode}
Releases the memory held by a process A . On success, print FREE A n x
where n is the amount of reclaimed memory and x is the start relative
address of the released memory. On error, print FAIL RELEASE A .
\end{DoxyCode}


\# L\+I\+ST A\+V\+A\+I\+L\+A\+B\+LE 
\begin{DoxyCode}
Prints location information for all available memory. Prints a list of pairs of "(n1,x1) (n2, x2)...", 
where is the amount available and is the starting
location. If there are no available blocks you should return FULL.
\end{DoxyCode}


\# L\+I\+ST A\+S\+S\+I\+G\+N\+ED 
\begin{DoxyCode}
Returns a list of space separates=d triples including of the form "
", where represents process labels, represents the number
of allocated bytes for that process, and is the relative starting address of the
process. If there are no allocated blocks, this should return NONE .
\end{DoxyCode}


\section*{F\+I\+ND}


\begin{DoxyCode}
Locates the starting address and size allocated by the process labeled A . If
successful, this command returns an tuple , where is the amount
allocated by A and x is the relative starting address of the process labeled
A .
\end{DoxyCode}
